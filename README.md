Assignment 1
For this assignment I created a replica login page that was provided by my lecturer from scratch using Atom to create the index.html file and designed the page where the codes for that are present in the design.css file.
The challenge I faced was definitely to change the shape of the image to a right-sided triangle and the placement of the logo on the top right hand corner.
However in the end I did manage to complete the login page and uploaded it to GitHub.
